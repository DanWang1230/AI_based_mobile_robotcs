# Motion planning: A*, RRT, and RRT*

In this project, we will implement A*, weighted A*, RRT, and RRT* for 2D motion planning in a grid world and study the parameters that govern their behaviors. For RRT and RRT*, we need to sample controls to generate possible motion rollouts from the graph.

Please see [here](Homework 3/HW3.pdf) for instructions and [here](Homework 3/hw3_writing.pdf) for results.
